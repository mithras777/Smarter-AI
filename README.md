# Smarter AI - MCM

## Overview

Improves enemy and boss AI in Baldur's Gate 3 by adding smarter archetypes, advanced combat tactics, and specific NPC behaviors.

## Key Features

### **General AI Improvements**
- Enemies intelligently evaluate resistances, immunities, and hit chances against your Armor Class (AC).
- Differentiates between summoners and summons, prioritizing the summoner in combat.
- Increased tactical awareness, such as finishing off downed characters and targeting low-HP spellcasters or rangers.
- Positioning now plays a critical role for both players and NPCs.

### **Combat Tactics**
- **Rangers:**
  - Prefer high ground for advantageous attacks.
  - Use throwables from a distance and fallback when overwhelmed.
  - Target environmental hazards like exploding barrels.
- **Melee Characters:**
  - Prioritize close combat and avoid attacking barrels.
  - Stand their ground when cornered.
- **General Tactics:**
  - Use control spells if party members are clustered together.
  - Shove characters into chasms or use fall damage more effectively.
  - Target spellcasters with active concentration spells to break their effects.
  - Enhanced boss mechanics for challenging encounters.

### **Specific NPC Behavior**
- **Goblins:** Tend to dogpile without much strategic thinking.
- **Bosses:** Smarter and more brutal, capable of analyzing player stats and abilities as if they had "Examine."
- **Dragons:** Hyper-aggressive and willing to self-damage for maximum impact.
- **Beasts:** Instinctively attack closer, low-HP characters, showing less awareness of immunities and concentration.
